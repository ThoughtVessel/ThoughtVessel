# Hi, I’m @ThoughtVessel
I'm a young programmer and I want to program computers and have fun.

## Interests
I am really interested in AI and backend programming. However, I also love to apply coding to 
engineering projects to create awesome machines, self controlled rockets, and other cool gadgets.

## Currently Learning
I am currently taking Andrew Ng's coursera course on machine learning. 

I am also learning the languages Matlab, Javascript, and Python.
